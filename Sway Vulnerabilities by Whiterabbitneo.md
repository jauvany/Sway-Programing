Here is a list of the 20 most common vulnerabilities related to Sway programming along with examples of possible mitigation techniques:

1. Integer Overflow/Underflow:
   - Exploitation: Attackers can manipulate arithmetic operations that cause the result to overflow or underflow, leading to unexpected behavior.
   - Mitigation: Use the `checked_add`, `checked_sub`, `checked_mul`, `checked_div` functions provided by the Sway standard library to perform arithmetic operations with overflow/underflow checks.
   - Example:
     ```sway
     use std::num::{checked_add, checked_sub};

     #[contract]
     mod my_contract {
         use super::*;

         #[mut]
         pub fn add(a: u64, b: u64) -> Option<u64> {
             checked_add(a, b)
         }

         #[mut]
         pub fn subtract(a: u64, b: u64) -> Option<u64> {
             checked_sub(a, b)
         }
     }
     ```

2. Reentrancy:
   - Exploitation: Attackers can exploit reentrancy vulnerabilities when a contract makes external calls to untrusted contracts.
   - Mitigation: Use the `nonreentrant` attribute to prevent reentrancy attacks.
   - Example:
     ```sway
     #[contract]
     mod my_contract {
         use super::*;

         #[mut]
         #[nonreentrant]
         pub fn transfer(to: Address, amount: u64) {
             // Transfer logic
         }
     }
     ```

3. Unprotected Function:
   - Exploitation: Attackers can directly call unprotected functions in a contract.
   - Mitigation: Use the `only_owner` attribute to restrict access to certain functions.
   - Example:
     ```sway
     #[contract]
     mod my_contract {
         use super::*;

         #[mut]
         #[only_owner]
         pub fn critical_function() {
             // Critical logic
         }
     }
     ```

4. Timestamp Dependence:
   - Exploitation: Attackers can manipulate the timestamp of the blockchain to their advantage.
   - Mitigation: Use the `block_timestamp` function provided by the Sway standard library to get the current block timestamp.
   - Example:
     ```sway
     #[contract]
     mod my_contract {
         use super::*;

         #[mut]
         pub fn check_deadline(deadline: u64) {
             assert!(block_timestamp() <= deadline, "Deadline has passed");
         }
     }
     ```

5. Uninitialized Storage Pointers:
   - Exploitation: Attackers can read uninitialized storage variables, which can lead to sensitive information disclosure.
   - Mitigation: Initialize storage variables properly.
   - Example:
     ```sway
     #[contract]
     mod my_contract {
         use super::*;

         #[storage(default)]
         pub let mut initialized_value: u64 = 0;

         #[mut]
         pub fn initialize_value(value: u64) {
             initialized_value = value;
         }
     }
     ```

6. Arbitrary Jump with Function Type:
   - Exploitation: Attackers can manipulate function types to perform unintended jumps.
   - Mitigation: Use the `only_owner` attribute to restrict access to certain functions.

         #[only_owner]
         pub fn execute_function(function: fn(u64) -> u64, value: u64) -> u64 {
             function(value)
         }
     }
     ```

7. DoS with (Unexpected) revert:

         pub fn validate_input(input: &[u8]) {
             assert!(is_valid_utf8(input), "Invalid UTF-8 input");
         }
     }
     ```
